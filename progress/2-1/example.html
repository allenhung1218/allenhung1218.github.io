                    Learning your odds of eventually developing domentia - a pressing concern for many,
                    especially those with a family history of it - requires medical testing and counseling. But
                    what if everyday behavior, like overlooking a couple of credit card payments or habitually
                    braking while driving, could foretell your risk? A spate of experiments is underway to
                    explore that possibility, reflecting the growing awareness that the pathologies underlying
                    dementia can begin years or even decades before symptoms emerge.
