                    published in 1973, he posed a problem beyond such a mission's cost and complexity: 
                    the possibility that life already existed on the red planet and that it might not play nice.

                    "It is possible that on Mars there are pathogens,"he wrote, "organisms which, if transported
                    to the terrestrial environment, might do enormous biological damage - a Martian plague."

                    Michael Crichton imagined a related scenario in his novel "The Andromeda Strain."
