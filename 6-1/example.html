                <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    The serect to happiness is to understand why we are unhappy, which is,
                    surprisingly, a difficult task.
                </p>
                <P>
                    <em>Note: The thesis statement must be positioned in the very beginning or the very end of
                    the opening paragraph.</em>

                <h2>Essay Outline</h2>
                <p>
                    <u>Exploring the unhappy side of us could actually makes us happy</u>,
                    because it really helps solve the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Exploring the unhappy side is difficult</u>, because the pressure could be
                    caused by multiple factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Procrastinated tasks are common problem, and completing these tasks usually 
                    <u>helps ease the anxiety</u>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Note: You simply break your thesis statement into multiple interrelated individual points,
                    which you want to elaborate on in seperate sections.</em>

                <p>
                    While <u>dealing with our hidden pressure</u> might not be a joyful experience, 
                    it is a process that we must go through to truly live a <u>happy life</u>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>The take-home message must be inferred from the concluding remarks, with keywords
                        echoing the thesis statement.
