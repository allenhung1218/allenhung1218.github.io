                My name is Allen Hung. I am from Hsinchu. I am currently a sophomore in the Department of Computer and Science, National Tsing-hua University, and I am serving as the vice president of the 
                student union of my department. It has also been a year since I entered the Department of Human Resources. I have no interest in programming in the beginning, but now I will take the initiative to complete the problem and even think about how to optimize my program to make it work more efficiently. 
                I think the main reason why I like programming is that the more I learn, the more I realize that programming can do more than I imagined, and the sense of accomplishment that I get from solving a problem is one of the reasons I'm obsessed with programming.
                The reason why I took this course is also because I want to learn how the web pages we usually see are actually implemented, especially those fancy-looking special effects and interactive functions. So far, I have also Have a preliminary understanding of the entire web page structure.
